## Created with Capacitor Create App

This template was created using [`@capacitor/create-app`](https://github.com/ionic-team/create-capacitor-app),
and comes with a very minimal shell for building an app.
A custom tsconfig.json was added aswell as a TypeScript Capacitor Config instead of the usual JSON-File format.
A basic trapeze.config.ts aswell as multiple npm scripts were added for a faster get-go

Scripted configs might get very helpfull with dynamic behaviour as they are easier customizable on the fly instead
and able to include additional scripts for more specific configuration.

### Using this template

The src folder should contain all sources that will go into the app. 

Every configuration to be executed must be executed from
capacitor.config.ts

In the config of the package.json "capacitor_live_server_address" and "capacitor_deployment_device" must be set
to your own needs. The port can be adjusted aswell

### Running this example

To run the provided example, you can use `npm start` command.

```bash
npm start
```
